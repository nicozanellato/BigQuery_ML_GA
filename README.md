# BigQuery_ML_GA
Example of how to create a Machine Learning (ML) model using BigQuery ML capabilities. Data is available from BigQuery public datasets and it is an extract form 2016-2017 Google Analytics account from Google Merchandise store. 

I have created various models using logistic regressions and boosted tree (XGBoost) algorithm to classify users that will return to the site and the probability of them purchasing an item in a later visit.

This is particularly useful and allows us to create and predict ML models in BigQuery, without using Python or any other programming language. The results from the following query, although simple, can be used to create audiences in Google Analytics that can be then used in Google Ads to target specific users and prompt them to purchase again.
